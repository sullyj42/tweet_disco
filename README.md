## API Storage
In the interest in simplicity as the author can barely keep his eyes open, all API keys shall be stored in seperate ascii text (.txt) files. 
These files will be easy to read for an external program, but *shall* be ignored by git. 
This *shall* be ensured by appropriately building the ".gitignore" file. 

Similarly, any data (initial, intermediate, or final), *should* be stored in a seperate file and similarly ignored by the ".gitignore" file.
